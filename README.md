# Tally_Addons

Tally add-ons are custom modules or extensions developed to enhance the functionality of Tally ERP 9 or TallyPrime. These add-ons are designed to meet specific business needs that are not available in the standard Tally package. They can be developed by third-party developers or by Tally Solutions' certified partners.
